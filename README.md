Custom printf in C programming language
Notes:
* THIS IS AN UNFINISHED PRINTF PROJECT
* Also, the file name forzee has no meaning and I have no plans to change
the name....figure out what it does yourself
* Spotify is short for "Spot specifier".....cooooool righht? you bet!
* any file name spotify* should actually be conversion* e.g
* spotify.c = conversion_arrays.c
* spotifying_arrays.c = conversion_arrays.h
* I have no idea why I'm giving these random names
    myself this much but, eh,whatev.

*hope to finish this before 2023 runs out
